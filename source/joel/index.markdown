Hi! I'm Joel and I run this site! I'm a Linux kernel developer and work in the Android kernel team at Google. My interests are scheduler, tracing, synchronization and kernel internals.

LinuxInternals.org is a resource I created as a collection of articles and resources exploring Linux Internals and Linux kernel related topics. At times I may write about hardware topics as well.

Follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/joel_linux), [Google+](https://plus.google.com/102415785508850230338) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joelagnel)

[My resume](/joel/joel-resume.pdf) covers a lot about my background and work experience.

[Here's a list](https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/LKML/list/?submitter=170577) of recent kernel patches I submitted. I got [featured on hackaday](http://hackaday.com/2014/06/08/the-in-circuit-sd-card-switch/) some time back.
