We're a growing community in Silicon Valley interested in learning all things Embedded, Linux and Internals.
Every couple of days, I give a talk discussing some aspect of Linux surrounding the kernel, boot loader, device drivers, file system, embedded systems etc..

[Come join us today, and check out when the next talk is!](http://www.meetup.com/LinuxInternals-org-Embedded-Linux-Training/)
